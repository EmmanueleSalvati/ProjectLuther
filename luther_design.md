### Design draft format

By end of w2d1 (Jan 20, 2015), you should be able to complete the following form for your project. However, keep in mind that throughout the design iterations of your project, many parts of it will likely change (i.e. increase/decrease in number of movies, types of characteristics, etc), so this is just a starting point.

####Client:

*Producer*

####Client's question/need:

*The Client would like to make a social documentary; how to reach the highest possible audience?*

####Description of my sample of movies:

They are classified as *Documentary - Political* in BoxOfficeMojo, look at:
[BoxOfficeMojo political documentaries](http://boxofficemojo.com/genres/chart/?id=politicaldoc.htm "BoxOfficeMojo political documentaries")
There is a list called *Most Popular Documentaries* on IMDB:
[IMDB Documentaries](http://www.imdb.com/search/title?title_type=documentary&sort=moviemeter,asc "IMDB Documentaries")
I could only find the list of top 100 documentaries on RottenTomatoes:
[Top 100 Documentary Movies on Rotten](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/top/bestofrt/top_100_documentary_movies/?category=8 "Top 100 Documentaries on Rotten")

####Characteristics of each movie:
I do not know (yet) how large will my sample of movies be, how to classify the movies, etc. As a starter I could look at:

* overall sales;
    - perhaps subdivided into movie theater, DVD, Netflix.
* reviews, ratings;
* how many times are they cited on Google News, or bbc.
